3D birthday card
----------------
A Little birthday card I hacked together in an afternoon for my sister's birthday. Uses 3D transforms and such, and a bit of shitty JS for opening and closing the card.

Forked from [Michael Duerinckx](http://codepen.io/michd/)'s Pen [3D birthday card](http://codepen.io/michd/pen/gxFmf/).
